Inspiration
- “Red Light and Green Light” from Squid Game
- Real-time multiplayer game using action recognition

Game Mechanism: How we modified
- Players must perform a given action during the green light to earn points
- Moving during the red light results in a score penalty
- The player with the highest score at the end wins

Technical Challenges
- Real-time human action recognition and movement detection
